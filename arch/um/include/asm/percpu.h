/*
 * The reused x86-64 BPF JIT emits percpu accesses via gs:[this_cpu_off]
 * and takes the symbol's address at compile time. UML has no gs-based
 * percpu addressing; the symbol is provided (by bpf_jit_shim.c) so the
 * JIT compiles and links. Direct-percpu BPF code paths are not exercised
 * by struct_ops/sched_ext; making them actually work under UML is
 * future work (FINDINGS.md).
 *
 * Guarded for assembler use: shared x86 .S files (e.g. clearbhb.S via
 * asm/nospec-branch.h) pull this header into __ASSEMBLY__ builds.
